# Mini Figma

This is smaller version of figma where you can do art in html and You will get the code in the console bar.  
  
There is Add Button on left panel which adds a box to the playground. Then you can Drag the box into desired position.  
   
The left panel is full of customisable stuffs to change the behaviour of Box. They are basically the css properties of the box.  
  

#### Some of them are : 
-  border (all properties)
- position 
- color(foreground/background)
- z-index (the priority to keep on top of another boxes) 
- height and width
